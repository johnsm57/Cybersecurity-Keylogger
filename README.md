# Cybersecurity-Keylogger
Cybersecurity Project - KeyLogging
Keylogger Script for Educational Purposes Purpose The purpose of this Python script is to serve as an educational tool for individuals seeking a deeper understanding of Python programming and cybersecurity concepts. Specifically, this script functions as a basic keylogger, capturing and logging key presses.

Usage This script is intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly and ethically. It provides a hands-on example for those interested in:

Python Programming: The script showcases the use of Python for interacting with the keyboard input and handling exceptions.

Cybersecurity Exploration: By studying the code, users can gain insights into basic cybersecurity principles related to keylogging. Understanding how keyloggers work is crucial for both defensive and offensive cybersecurity measures.

Components pynput Module: The script utilizes the pynput library to interact with the keyboard and monitor key presses.

keyPressed Function: This function is the core of the keylogger. It processes the pressed keys, prints their representation, and appends the corresponding characters to a file named "keyfile.txt." The error handling demonstrates how to deal with exceptions when attempting to get the character representation of a key.

Ethical Considerations It is essential to emphasize that the use of keyloggers, even for educational purposes, must adhere to ethical standards and legal regulations. Unauthorized monitoring of keystrokes is a potential violation of privacy and can have serious consequences. This script should only be used in controlled environments for educational exploration and should not be deployed without explicit consent.

How to Run Ensure Python is installed on your system. Install the required library by running: pip install pynput. Correct the typo in the script: change if name_ == "__main": to if name == "main":. Run the script. Conclusion This script serves as a learning resource for Python enthusiasts interested in cybersecurity. It is crucial to use this knowledge responsibly and ethically, respecting privacy and legal boundaries. Understanding keyloggers contributes to a well-rounded comprehension of both programming and cybersecurity practices.

Welcome to the Cybersecurity-Project wiki!

This project is used as a test my skills in python for keylogging.. Dangerous am I right? Lets do some explaining in this project.. Well actually before I do that. There are some small typos but only to prevent bad bad bad people from using the code. I even used chatgpt to help with that as proof. I mean come on its 2023.

(missing a double underscore somewhere)

ABOUT I would like to expand my python skills in my IT career and decided to create a keylogger.

What's a keylogger? Glad you asked.... Long story short, whatever you type I receive in a txt file. Basically allowing me to see your Wifi passwords.. Your Facebook passwords.. etc.
